1.  Introduction

   RFCs are not be suited for documenting YANG modules.  However,
   implementers/vendors are looking for reference models and
   sufficiently stable models to refer to.  To that aim, this document
   proposes a new approach for documenting IETF-endorsed YANG modules.

   Guidance for writing YANG modules are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].  Guidelines related to code components
   (Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]) or citations to
   references listed in the YANG module do not apply for VELOCE.

   This document mainly focuses on IETF modules.  Note that
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis] includes provisons for IANA-maintained
   modules to not be included in RFCs:

   |  Designers of IANA-maintained modules MAY supply the full initial
   |  version of the module in a specification document that registers
   |  the module or only a script to be used (including by IANA) for
   |  generating the module (e.g., an XSLT stylesheet as in Appendix A
   |  of [RFC9108]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  VELOCE Procedure

   The following procedure is followed when a WG adopts a YANG module:

   *  A new repository MUST be created by the WG Chairs following the
      procedure in Section 3.2 of [RFC8874] to maintain the YANG Module,
      with the apprpriate CI/CD YANG validation in place.  Other
      administrative polices are defined in [RFC8875].  The same
      procedure for managing WG documents (e.g., assign editors) applies
      for managing YANG modules (Section 6.1 of [RFC2418]).  Refer also
      to Section 3.3 of [RFC8874] for considerations related to granting
      WG participants write and administrators right.

   *  Contributing methods to YANG module (including issues handling
      andd merge procedure) are similar to those defined in Section 4 of
      [RFC8874].

   *  The WG Chairs MUST seek in a timely manner after the adoption of
      the document for the publication of an RFC that describes the
      initial module objectives and, more importantly, registers the URI
      in the "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]
      and the YANG module in the "YANG Module Names" subregistry
      [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters" registry.

   *  The YANG module MUST NOT be inserted in the document; instead a
      link to the Github repository MUST be included.

   *  Bis versions of the initial RFC MAY be considered to document
      major changes or their rationale.  Such a decision is left to the
      WG Chairs.

4.  Security Considerations

   The same considerations discussed in Section 10 of [RFC8874] apply
   here.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
