1.  Introduction

   RFCs are not suited for documenting and maintaining YANG modules.
   However, implementers/vendors are looking for reference models and
   sufficiently stable models to refer to.  To that aim, this document
   proposes a new approach for documenting IETF-endorsed YANG modules.

   Guidance for writing YANG modules are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].  Guidelines related to code components
   (Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]) or citations to
   references listed in the YANG module do not apply for VELOCE.

   This document mainly focuses on IETF modules.  Note that
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis] includes provisons for IANA-maintained
   modules to not be included in RFCs:

   |  The authors MUST include a note to the RFC Editor requesting that
   |  the appendix be removed before publication as RFC and that RFC
   |  IIII is replaced with the RFC number that is assigned to the
   |  document.  Initial versions of IANA-maintained modules that are
   |  published in RFCs may be misused despite the appropriate language
   |  to refer to the IANA registry to retrieve the up-to-date module.
   |  This is problematic for interoperability, e.g., when values are
   |  deprecated or are associated with a new meaning.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  VELOCE Procedure

   The following procedure is followed when a WG adopts a new YANG
   module or update to an existing YANG module:

   *  A new WG repository (Section 4) MUST be created by the WG Chairs
      following the procedure in Section 3.2 of [RFC8874] to maintain
      the YANG Module, with the appropriate CI/CD YANG validation in
      place.

      -  The same procedure for managing WG documents (e.g., assign
         editors) applies for managing YANG modules (Section 6.1 of
         [RFC2418]).

      -  Refer also to Section 3.3 of [RFC8874] for considerations
         related to granting WG participants write and administrators
         right.

      -  Other administrative policies are defined in [RFC8875].

      -  A release tagging mechanism should be defined to track the
         intermediate versions referenced by WG I-Ds and by the RFC,
         once published.

   *  Contributing methods to YANG module (including issues handling and
      merge procedure) are similar to those defined in Section 4 of
      [RFC8874].  A procedure to assessing consensus is discussed in
      Section 7 of [RFC8874].

   *  The WG (WG Chairs) MUST seek in a timely manner after the adoption
      of the YANG module for the publication of an RFC that describes
      the initial module objectives and, more importantly, registers the
      URI in the "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry"
      [RFC3688] and the YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
      subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters" registry.

         Unless we update these rules as well, the publication of the
         initial RFC is required per Section 14 of [RFC6020], especially
         the following:

         "There are no initial assignments.

         For allocation, RFC publication is required"

   *  The YANG module MUST NOT be inserted in the document; instead a
      link to the above repository MUST be included.

   *  Bis versions of the initial RFC MAY be considered to document
      major changes and their rationale.  Such a decision is left to the
      WG.  The RFC update is scoped to the narrative part describing the
      updates.

   *  Bis versions of the initial RFC should be developed by the same WG
      which was responsible for producing the intial RFC.  If the
      responsible WG concluded, the alternative WG should be consulted
      with the ADs.

4.  IETF-hosted Repository

   It is RECOMMENDED that IETF self-hosted repositories are used.
   Integration using third-party hosted repositories MAY be used for
   experimentation purposes.

      DISCUSSION: Include a recommendation about the hosting.  IANA or
      some IETF gitlab are examples of self-hosting.  Example of third-
      part hosted facility is GitHub.

5.  Operational Considerations

   The VELOCE approach is meant to address some of operational issues
   encountered using current YANG development approach within the IETF.
   Specification, VELOCE ambitions to:

   *  Ease integration for operators by providing readily-available YANG
      code in a well-identified location.

   *  Encourage an iterative approach that would fit most of operators
      needs, rather than waiting for a "perfect" version that solves
      every deployment case.

   *  Catalyst to produce fully-validated modules in a timely manner.

   *  Ease reuse/leveraging by other organizations and hopefully avoid
      redundant efforts.

   *  Welcome contributors from the operators community who are more
      familiar with software development, not only with specification
      development.

6.  Security Considerations

   The same considerations discussed in Section 10 of [RFC8874] apply
   here.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
