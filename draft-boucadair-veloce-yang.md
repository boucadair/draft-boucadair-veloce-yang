# Introduction

Charter a WG for YANG deVELpment PrOCEss & maintenance (VELOCE) with the aim to produce good but quick models: RFCs might not be suited for documenting YANG modules. However, implementers/vendors are looking for “reference models” and “sufficiently stable models”. An hybrid approach should be investigated for documenting IETF-endorsed YANG modules, such as considering an RFC to describe the initial module sketch and objectives, an official IETF repository for maintaining intermediate YANG versions, a process to release stable YANG modules versions. For example, the WG may build on RFC8874 and document YANG-related process to manage YANG modules using resources such as GitHub. The procedure for when to bump revisions, whether/when mirror in an RFC, and other similar logistic matters will be documented as well.
